This github repository contains all of the theory that I have studied at PTITHCM. Besides, each folder also has my answer, a solution for Homework, and a python code to illustrate the theories, algorithms, and a model.


And when I finish all the theory and assignments, I will do the project. It is called "Multiple Disease Prediction".
